# JavaScript Call Stack

## üìö What is the Call Stack?

The **Call Stack** is a mechanism in JavaScript that keeps track of function execution. It operates in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** manner, meaning the last function added to the stack is the first one to be executed.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Does the Call Stack Work?

1. **Function Invocation**: When a function is called, it is added to the stack.
2. **Execution**: The function executes its code.
3. **Completion**: Once the function finishes, it is removed from the stack.
4. **Nested Calls**: If a function calls another function, the new function is added to the stack.
